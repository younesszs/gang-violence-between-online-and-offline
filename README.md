# Gang-violence-between-online-and-offline
 This project investigates the causal pathways and magnitude between the digital world (social media like Facebook) and real word crimes. To do this we use a point process, i.e., bivariate Hawkes process. The latter entails in it the spillover direction as well as its magnitude  between Gangs' activities online. This code generates synthetic data to mimic this conflict. The user can specify the number of gangs as well as the time window that they want to study the dynamics in. 

## The detailed study on real data from Chicago can be found in our published paper: Measuring Onlineâ€“Offline Spillover of Gang Violence Using Bivariate Hawkes Processes

## The parameter estimation is done using the probabilistic softwar Stan, which can be installed very easily using pip or conda.
